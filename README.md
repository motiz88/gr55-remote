# GR-55 Editor

An experimental, unofficial patch editing app for the [Roland GR-55 guitar synthesizer](https://www.roland.com/uk/products/gr-55/).

The app is built with React Native and Expo for the Web, Android and iOS. It uses the Web MIDI API (via https://github.com/motiz88/react-native-midi) to send and receive patch data.

**This repo is a work in progress**. Links to downloadable builds of the app are coming soon.
